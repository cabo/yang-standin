--- abstract

YANG (RFC 7950) is a data modeling language used to model
configuration data, state data, parameters and results of Remote
Procedure Call (RPC) operations or actions, and notifications.

YANG-CBOR (RFC 9254) defines encoding rules for YANG in the Concise Binary
Object Representation (CBOR) (RFC 8949).
While the overall structure of YANG-CBOR is encoded in an efficient,
binary format, YANG itself has its roots in XML and therefore
traditionally encodes some information such as date/times and IP
addresses/prefixes in a verbose text form.

This document defines how to use existing CBOR tags for this kind of
information in YANG-CBOR as a "stand-in" for the text-based
information that would be found in the original form of YANG-CBOR.

# Introduction

(see abstract)


# Conventions and Definitions

The terminology of {{-yang-cbor}} applies.

Legacy representation:
: The (often text-based) representation for a YANG data item as used
  in YANG-XML, YANG-JSON, and (unchanged) YANG-CBOR.

Stand-in tag:
: A CBOR tag that can supply the information that is equivalent to a
  legacy representation in a more efficient format (e.g., using binary
  data).

Encoder:
: The party which generates (sends) CBOR data described by YANG.

Intermediate Encoder:
: An encoder which isn't the original author of the data, converting it
  from legacy representation.

Aggressive Intermediate Encoder:
: An intermediate encoder that might choose to discard some
  information of a legacy representation in order to be able to use a
  stand-in tag.
  Such a choice may be based on knowledge of the Decoder's handling of
  such information (e.g, to accommodate intolerant decoders), or it
  may be a general characteristic of the service provided by the
  intermediate encoder (e.g., in order to serve as a legacy-eschewing
  encoder).

Legacy-Eschewing Encoder:
: An encoder that does not generate legacy representations in places
  where a stand-in tag might instead be used.
  An intermediate encoder may need to be aggressive to achieve this.

Decoder:
: The party which receives and parses CBOR data described by YANG.

Intolerant Decoder:
: A decoder that does not accept legacy representations in places
  where a stand-in tag might instead be used.
  Such a decoder is designed to interoperate only with an
  legacy-eschewing encoder.

Intermediate Decoder:
: A decoder which isn't the final recipient of the data, converting it
  to legacy representation.

Data Transfer:
: A series of actions, generally beginning by data origination, encoding,
  continuing by optional intermediate transcoding, sending and receiving,
  and finally decoding and consuming.

Round Trip:
: Part of a data transfer between an encoder generating CBOR data with
  stand-in tags and a decoder parsing the data.

Legacy Round Trip:
: A Round Trip where the encoder is an intermediate encoder or the decoder is
  an intermediate decoder and any of these converts from or to the
  legacy representation.

Unambiguous Round Trip:
: A Legacy Round Trip that provides exactly the same legacy representation
  (not just semantically equivalent).
  The stand-in tag is also said to "unambiguously stand in" for the
  legacy representation.

# Stand-In Tags

This document defines two sets of stand-in tags.
Where information starts out in a legacy representation, these tags
are only used when an Unambiguous Round Trip can be achieved.

## `ietf-yang-types`: Tag 1 (Date/Time) and Tag 100 (Date)

{{Section 3 of -legacy-bis}} defines the following types in `ietf-yang-types`:

YANG type | base type | specification | stand-in
date-and-time | string | {{-yang-types}} | tag 1
date | string | {{-legacy-bis}} | (none)
date-no-zone | string | {{-legacy-bis}} | tag 100
{: title="Legacy representations in ietf-yang-types"}

Tag 1 ({{Section 3.4.2 of RFC8949@-cbor}}) can unambiguously stand in for all `date-and-time` values that:

* do not specify a time zone (note that {{-legacy-bis}}
uses the legacy "`-00:00`" format for time-zone-free date-times)
* are not an inserted leap second (23:59:60 or 23:59:61)
* do not have trailing zeroes in the fractional part of the seconds.
* do not have fractional parts of the seconds with a precision that
  cannot be represented in floating-point tag content in a tag 1.

All other `date-and-time` values stay in legacy representation.

Tag 1 uses an integer tag content for all `date-and-time` values
without fractional seconds and a floating-point tag content for values
that have fractional seconds given.

Tag 100 {{-date}} can unambiguously stand in for all `date-no-zone` values.

## `ietf-inet-types`: Tags 54 and 52 (IP addresses and prefixes)

{{Section 4 of -legacy-bis}} defines in `ietf-inet-types`:

YANG type | base type | specification | stand-in
ip-address | union | {{-yang-types}} | (see union)
ipv6-address | string | {{-yang-types}} | tag 54
ipv4-address | string | {{-yang-types}} | tag 52
ip-address-no-zone | union | RFC 6991 | (see union)
ipv6-address-no-zone | ipv6-address | RFC 6991 | tag 54
ipv4-address-no-zone | ipv4-address | RFC 6991 | tag 52
ip-address-link-local | union | {{-legacy-bis}} | (see union)
ipv6-address-link-local | ipv6-address | {{-legacy-bis}} | tag 54
ipv4-address-link-local | ipv4-address | {{-legacy-bis}} | tag 52
ip-prefix | union | {{-yang-types}} | (see union)
ipv6-prefix | string | {{-yang-types}} | tag 54
ipv4-prefix | string | {{-yang-types}} | tag 52
ip-address-and-prefix | union | {{-legacy-bis}} | (see union)
ipv6-address-and-prefix | string | {{-legacy-bis}} | tag 54
ipv4-address-and-prefix | string | {{-legacy-bis}} | tag 52
{: title="Legacy representations in ietf-yang-types"}

An intermediate encoder MAY normalize IPv6 addresses and prefixes that do not comply with {{RFC5952}}
but can be converted into the stand-in representation.
For example, IPv6 address written as 2001:db8:: is the same as 2001:0db8::0:0 and both would
be converted to `54(h'20010db8000000000000000000000000')`, anyway only the
first one complies with {{RFC5952}}. The encoder MAY refuse to convert the
latter one.

If the schema specifies
`ip-prefix`, an intermediate encoder MAY normalize prefixes with non-zero bits after the prefix end.
For example, if the legacy representation of `ipv6-prefix` is 2001:db8:1::/40, the encoder
may either refuse it as malformed or convert it to 2001:db8::/40 and represent
as `54([40, h'20010db8'])`.

The encoder implementation should be clear about which normalizations are employed and how.

Adapted examples from {{-cbor-ip}}:

Stand-in representation of IPv6 address 2001:db8:1234:deed:beef:cafe:face:feed
is `54(h'20010db81234deedbeefcafefacefeed')`.

TO DO: adapt more examples from {{-cbor-ip}}

TO DO: Check how the unions in {{-yang-types}} and {{-legacy-bis}} interact
with this.  E.g., the union ip-address needs to be parsed to decide
between tag 54 and tag 52.

## Union handling

When the schema specifies a union data type for a node, there are
additional requirements on the encoder and decoder.

An encoder which is fully aware of data semantics MUST use the appropriate
data type, even though it isn't formally specified by the schema.

If an intermediate encoder doesn't fully understand the data semantics,
it needs to find out which type the data actually is to choose the right stand-in.
If more types are possible, it MAY choose any of these which allow for an Unambiguous Round Trip,
otherwise it SHOULD keep the legacy representation.

If a decoder receives data for a union-typed node, it MUST accept any data type
of the union, even though it may violate additional constraints outside the schema.

# Using Stand-In Tags

## Defining Stand-In Usage in Schema

TO DO: formally define the YANG extension

## Original stand-ins

The simplest situation is when no intermediate encoders and decoders are
involved in the data transfer, therefore the round trip is not legacy.
In this case, no conversions are involved and data is validated using the
schema extension from the previous section.

## Legacy Round Trip

Producing a stand-in MUST be triggered by schema usage. Intermediate encoders
MUST NOT encode stand-ins when no schema is available.

It's generally not recommended to do a legacy round trip where both the encoder
and decoder are converting from and to the legacy representation.

# Negotiation

Introducing stand-in tags in YANG-CBOR requires some form of consent
between the producer and the consumer of YANG-CBOR information:

* A producer that creates YANG-CBOR containing stand-in tags needs to
  know whether the consumer supports stand-in tags, and, possibly,
  which specific stand-in tags it supports.  We speak about the
  _capability_ of a consumer to consume stand-in tags.
  A producer MUST NOT employ stand-in tags unless it knows about the
  capabilities of the consumer.
  A consumer SHOULD indicate its capabilities for consuming stand-in tags.

* A consumer may not want to implement certain legacy text-based
  representations where more efficient (and easy to implement)
  stand-in tags are available, i.e., it may use an intolerant decoder.
  This places a _requirement_ on the
  producer to use a legacy-eschewing encoder (which therefore needs to
  have the _capability_ to produce YANG-CBOR
  where those stand-in tags are used, in place of legacy
  representations).
  Where the consumer employs an intolerant decoder, stand-in tags are
  _required_ by the consumer: for interoperating with a producer's
  encoder, this MUST be legacy-eschewing, i.e. it MUST NOT employ
  legacy representations.
  A consumer that has requirements for only receiving stand-in tags in
  place of legacy representations, MUST indicate this to the producer.

ISSUE: Where do we put those two aspects of negotiation?

* NETCONF negotiation
* yang-library
* media-type parameters
* ?

# Security Considerations

TODO Security


# IANA Considerations

## stand-in tags?

ISSUE: Do we want to have a separate registry for stand-in tags?

They already are CBOR tags and thus in the registry, but might
get lost in the bulk of that (and are only identified as YANG-CBOR
stand-in Tags in the specification).

## media-type parameters

ISSUE: Should the use of stand-in tags be mentioned in the various
YANG-CBOR-based media types (as a media type parameter)?

Compare how application/yang-data+cbor can use id=name/id=sid to
indicate another encoding decision.
