                      Stand-in Tags for YANG-CBOR
                 draft-bormann-cbor-yang-standin-latest

Abstract

   YANG (RFC 7950) is a data modeling language used to model
   configuration data, state data, parameters and results of Remote
   Procedure Call (RPC) operations or actions, and notifications.

   YANG-CBOR (RFC 9254) defines encoding rules for YANG in the Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (RFC 8949).  While the overall
   structure of YANG-CBOR is encoded in an efficient, binary format,
   YANG itself has its roots in XML and therefore traditionally encodes
   some information such as date/times and IP addresses/prefixes in a
   verbose text form.

   This document defines how to use existing CBOR tags for this kind of
   information in YANG-CBOR as a "stand-in" for the text-based
   information that would be found in the original form of YANG-CBOR.

1.  Introduction

   (see abstract)

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The terminology of [RFC9254] applies.

   Legacy representation:  The (often text-based) representation for a
      YANG data item as used in YANG-XML, YANG-JSON, and (unchanged)
      YANG-CBOR.

   Stand-in tag:  A CBOR tag that can supply the information that is
      equivalent to a legacy representation in a more efficient format
      (e.g., using binary data).

   Encoder:  The party which generates (sends) CBOR data described by
      YANG.

   Intermediate Encoder:  An encoder which isn't the original author of
      the data, converting it from legacy representation.

   Decoder:  The party which receives and parses CBOR data described by
      YANG.

   Intermediate Decoder:  A decoder which isn't the final recipient of
      the data, converting it to legacy representation.

   Data Transfer:  A series of actions, generally beginning by data
      origination, encoding, continuing by optional intermediate
      transcoding, sending and receiving, and finally decoding and
      consuming.

   Round Trip:  Part of a data transfer between an encoder generating
      CBOR data with stand-in tags and a decoder parsing the data.

   Legacy Round Trip:  A Round Trip where the encoder is an intermediate
      encoder or the decoder is an intermediate decoder and any of these
      converts from or to the legacy representation.

   Unambiguous Round Trip:  A Legacy Round Trip that provides exactly
      the same legacy representation (not just semantically equivalent).
      The stand-in tag is also said to "unambiguously stand in" for the
      legacy representation.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Stand-In Tags

   This document defines two sets of stand-in tags.  Where information
   starts out in a legacy representation, these tags are only used when
   an Unambiguous Round Trip can be achieved.

3.1.  ietf-yang-types: Tag 1 (Date/Time) and Tag 100 (Date)

   Section 3 of [I-D.schoenw-netmod-rfc6991-bis] defines the following
   types in ietf-yang-types:

   +===============+======+==================================+========+
   | YANG type     |base  | specification                    |stand-in|
   |               |type  |                                  |        |
   +===============+======+==================================+========+
   | date-and-time |string| [RFC6021]                        |tag 1   |
   +---------------+------+----------------------------------+--------+
   | date          |string| [I-D.schoenw-netmod-rfc6991-bis] |(none)  |
   +---------------+------+----------------------------------+--------+
   | date-no-zone  |string| [I-D.schoenw-netmod-rfc6991-bis] |tag 100 |
   +---------------+------+----------------------------------+--------+

            Table 1: Legacy representations in ietf-yang-types

   Tag 1 (Section 3.4.2 of RFC 8949 [STD94]) can unambiguously stand in
   for all date-and-time values that:

   *  do not specify a time zone (note that
      [I-D.schoenw-netmod-rfc6991-bis] uses the legacy "-00:00" format
      for time-zone-free date-times)

   *  are not an inserted leap second (23:59:60 or 23:59:61)

   *  do not have trailing zeroes in the fractional part of the seconds.

   *  do not have fractional parts of the seconds with a precision that
      cannot be represented in floating-point tag content in a tag 1.

   All other date-and-time values stay in legacy representation.

   Tag 1 uses an integer tag content for all date-and-time values
   without fractional seconds and a floating-point tag content for
   values that have fractional seconds given.

   Tag 100 [RFC8943] can unambiguously stand in for all date-no-zone
   values.

3.2.  ietf-inet-types: Tags 54 and 52 (IP addresses and prefixes)

   Section 4 of [I-D.schoenw-netmod-rfc6991-bis] defines in ietf-inet-
   types:

   +=============+============+================================+======+

            Table 2: Legacy representations in ietf-yang-types

   An intermediate encoder MAY normalize IPv6 addresses and prefixes
   that do not comply with [RFC5952] but can be converted into the
   stand-in representation.  For example, IPv6 address written as
   2001:db8:: is the same as 2001:0db8::0:0 and both would be converted
   to 54(h'20010db8000000000000000000000000'), anyway only the first one
   complies with [RFC5952].  The encoder MAY refuse to convert the
   latter one.

   If the schema specifies ip-prefix, an intermediate encoder MAY
   normalize prefixes with non-zero bits after the prefix end.  For
   example, if the legacy representation of ipv6-prefix is
   2001:db8:1::/40, the encoder may either refuse it as malformed or
   convert it to 2001:db8::/40 and represent as 54([40, h'20010db8']).

   The encoder implementation should be clear about which normalizations
   are employed and how.

   Adapted examples from [RFC9164]:

   Stand-in representation of IPv6 address
   2001:db8:1234:deed:beef:cafe:face:feed is
   54(h'20010db81234deedbeefcafefacefeed').

   CBOR encoding of stand-in (19 bytes):

   cbor-pretty D8 36 # tag(54) 50 # bytes(16)
   20010DB81234DEEDBEEFCAFEFACEFEED

   CBOR encoding of legacy representation (40 bytes):

   cbor-pretty 78 26 # text(38) 323030313A6462383A313233343A646565643A62
   6565663A636166653A666163653A66656564

   Stand-in representation of IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:1234::/48 is 54([48,
   h'20010db81234']).

   CBOR encoding of stand-in (12 bytes):

   cbor-pretty D8 36 # tag(54) 82 # array(2) 18 30 # unsigned(48) 46 #
   bytes(6) 20010DB81234 # " \u0001\r\xB8\u00124"

   CBOR encoding of legacy representation (19 bytes):

   "2001:db8:1234::/48"

   Stand-in representation of IPv6 link-local address
   fe80::0202:02ff:ffff:fe03:0303/64%eth0 is
   54([h'fe8000000000020202fffffffe030303', 64, 'eth0']).

   CBOR encoding of stand-in (27 bytes):

   cbor-pretty D8 36 # tag(54) 83 # array(3) 50 # bytes(16)
   FE8000000000020202FFFFFFFE030303 18 40 # unsigned(64) 44 # bytes(4)

   TO DO: adapt more examples from [RFC9164]

   TO DO: Check how the unions in [RFC6021] and
   [I-D.schoenw-netmod-rfc6991-bis] interact with this.  E.g., the union
   ip-address needs to be parsed to decide between tag 54 and tag 52.

3.3.  Union handling

   When the schema specifies a union data type for a node, there are
   additional requirements on the encoder and decoder.

   An encoder which is fully aware of data semantics MUST use the
   appropriate data type, even though it isn't formally specified by the
   schema.

   If an intermediate encoder doesn't fully understand the data
   semantics, it needs to find out which type the data actually is to
   choose the right stand-in.  If more types are possible, it MAY choose
   any of these which allow for an Unambiguous Round Trip, otherwise it
   SHOULD keep the legacy representation.

   If a decoder receives data for a union-typed node, it MUST accept any
   data type of the union, even though it may violate additional
   constraints outside the schema.

4.  Using Stand-In Tags

4.1.  Defining Stand-In Usage in Schema

   TO DO: formally define the YANG extension

4.2.  Original stand-ins

   The simplest situation is when no intermediate encoders and decoders
   are involved in the data transfer, therefore the round trip is not
   legacy.  In this case, no conversions are involved and data is
   validated using the schema extension from the previous section.

4.3.  Legacy Round Trip

   Producing a stand-in MUST be triggered by schema usage.  Intermediate
   encoders MUST NOT encode stand-ins when no schema is available.

   It's generally not recommended to do a legacy round trip where both
   the encoder and decoder are converting from and to the legacy
   representation.

5.  Negotiation

   Introducing stand-in tags in YANG-CBOR requires some form of consent
   between the producer and the consumer of YANG-CBOR information:

   *  A producer that creates YANG-CBOR containing stand-in tags needs
      to know whether the consumer supports stand-in tags, and,
      possibly, which specific stand-in tags it supports.  We speak
      about the _capability_ of a consumer to consume stand-in tags.  A
      producer MUST NOT employ stand-in tags unless it knows about the
      capabilities of the consumer.  A consumer SHOULD indicate its
      capabilities for consuming stand-in tags.

   *  A consumer may not want to implement certain legacy text-based
      representations where more efficient (and easy to implement)
      stand-in tags are available.  This places a _requirement_ on the
      producer (which needs to have the _capability_ to produce YANG-
      CBOR where those stand-in tags are used, in place of legacy
      representations).  A producer MUST NOT employ legacy
      representations where stand-in tags are _required_ by the
      consumer.  A consumer that has requirements for only receiving
      stand-in tags in place of legacy representations, MUST indicate
      this to the producer.

   ISSUE: Where do we put those two aspects of negotiation?

   *  NETCONF negotiation

   *  yang-library

   *  media-type parameters

   *  ?

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  stand-in tags?

   ISSUE: Do we want to have a separate registry for stand-in tags?

   They already are CBOR tags and thus in the registry, but might get
   lost in the bulk of that (and are only identified as YANG-CBOR stand-
   in Tags in the specification).

7.2.  media-type parameters

   ISSUE: Should the use of stand-in tags be mentioned in the various
   YANG-CBOR-based media types (as a media type parameter)?

   Compare how application/yang-data+cbor can use id=name/id=sid to
   indicate another encoding decision.
